# Illustrator-Grid-and-Margin-Script
This Adobe Illustrator script generates a customizable grid and calculates margins using the diagonal line of the artboard. The margin calculation is inspired by the Pythagorean theorem. Users can specify the number of grid rows, columns, and the division of the diagonal line for margin calculation through window prompts.
